The `README.md` file is automatically generated from the `src/README.md` file. EDIT `src/README.md` and rewrite it to your needs. Some labels in the `src/README.md` file will be automatically replaced in the generated `README.md`:

- &#123;&#123;PKG_NAME&#125;&#125; is automatically replaced with property `name` in `package.json` file.
- &#123;&#123;PKG_CAMELCASE&#125;&#125; will be replaced by a came case transformation of the package_name
- It has also some automatically added badges, that you  and remove if desired.


Consider documenting your code with [TsCode](https://tsdoc.org/) so that the autogenerated [API](./docs/API.md) is more useful for the reader.

## Installation

`@my-org/my-package-name` can be imported to your project with `npm`:

```bash
npm install @my-org/my-package-name
```

NPM installation defaults to the ES6 module for browsers and the CJS one for Node.js.

For web browsers, you could also directly download the IIFE bundle or the ESM bundle from the repository.

## Usage examples

Import your module as :

- Node.js

   ```javascript
   const myPackageName = require('@my-org/my-package-name')
   ... // your code here
   ```

- JavaScript native or TypeScript project (including React and Angular)

   ```javascript
   import * as myPackageName from '@my-org/my-package-name'
   ... // your code here
   ```

   If you are using Angular, since this library uses node typings, you should also add them to the `angularCompilerOptions` in your `tsconfig.json`:

   ```json
     "angularCompilerOptions": {
       "types": ["node"]
       ...
     }
   ```

- JavaScript native browser ES module

   ```html
   <script type="module">
     import * as myPackageName from 'index.browser.bundle.mod.js'  // Use your actual path to the browser mod bundle, which you can find in the dist directory
     ...  // your code here
   </script>
   ```

- JavaScript native browser IIFE

   ```html
   <head>
     ...
     <script src="index.browser.bundle.iife.js"></script><!-- Use your actual path to the browser iife bundle, which you can find in the dist -->
   </head>
   <body>
     ...
     <script>
       ...  // your code here
     </script>
   </body>
   ```

An example of usage could be:

```javascript
